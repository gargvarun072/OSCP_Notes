# Services and their details

#### Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)

a Microsoft Windows protocol based on the Domain Name System (DNS) packet format that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local link

#### Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)

a Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant default gateway

This is exclusive to Cisco and allows a default router address to be configured to be used in the event that the primary router fails.

#### Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)

a computer networking protocol that provides for automatic assignment of available Internet Protocol (IP) routers to participating hosts

#### VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)

a Cisco proprietary protocol that propagates the definition of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN) on the whole local area network

#### Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks

#### Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+)

a protocol developed by Cisco that handles authentication, authorisation, and accounting (AAA) services

#### Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

an authentication framework frequently used in wireless networks and point-to-point connections

#### Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP)

a proprietary wireless LAN authentication method developed by Cisco

#### Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) 

A routing protocol that operates within an autonomous system, which is a network under a single administrative control. Includes IGRP, EGRP, RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP 
 

#### Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) 

an encryption programme that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication 

used or signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, emails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of email communications 

#### Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) 

A standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reach-ability information among autonomous systems on the Internet. The protocol is classified as a path vector protocol.

### Router Protocol 
a protocol used between routers so that they can learn routes to add to their routing tables. 

#### Link State Routing 
A routing method that floods routing information to all routers within a network to build and maintain a more complex network route database. 

 

#### Distance Vector Routing 
Each router passes a copy of its routing table to its adjacent neighbors. The neighbor adds the route to its own table, incrementing the metric to reflect the extra distance to the end network. The distance is given as a hop count; the vector component specifies the address of the next hop.  

#### Hybrid Routing 
Routing protocol that uses the attributes of both distance vector and link state
