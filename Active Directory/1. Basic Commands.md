## Basic overview

Active Directory allows network administrators to create and manage domains, users, and objects within a network. For example, an admin can create a group of users and give them specific access privileges to certain directories on the server. As a network grows, Active Directory provides a way to organize a large number of users into logical groups and subgroups, while providing access control at each level.

The Active Directory structure includes three main tiers: 1) domains, 2) trees, and 3) forests. Several objects (users or devices) that all use the same database may be grouped in to a single domain. Multiple domains can be combined into a single group called a tree. Multiple trees may be grouped into a collection called a forest. Each one of these levels can be assigned specific access rights and communication privileges.

#### Run Powershell
```bash
# -ep bypasses the execution policy of powershell allowing you to easily run scripts
powershell -ep bypass
```

#### Get the basic details for Active Directory
```bash
# Basic enumeration to identify the forest, domain, parent
$ADClass = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]
$ADClass::GetCurrentDomain()

net user
net user /domain
net user admin /domain
```

#### Recon Active Directory (No creds/sessions)
```bash
enum4linux -a -u "" -p "" <DC IP> && enum4linux -a -u "guest" -p "" <DC IP>
smbmap -u "" -p "" -P 445 -H <DC IP> && smbmap -u "guest" -p "" -P 445 -H <DC IP>
smbclient -U '%' -L //<DC IP> && smbclient -U 'guest%' -L //
```

#### User enumeration
```bash
~/go/bin/kerbrute userenum --dc spookysec.local -d spookysec.local userlist.txt
```
